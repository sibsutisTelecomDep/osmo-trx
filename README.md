About OsmoTRX
=============

OsmoTRX is a software-defined radio transceiver that implements the Layer 1
physical layer of a BTS comprising the following 3GPP specifications:

* TS 05.01 *Physical layer on the radio path*
* TS 05.02 *Multiplexing and Multiple Access on the Radio Path*
* TS 05.04 *Modulation*
* TS 05.10 *Radio subsystem synchronization*

OsmoTRX is originally based on the transceiver code from the
[OpenBTS](https://osmocom.org/projects/osmobts/wiki/OpenBTS) project, but setup
to operate independently with the purpose of using with non-OpenBTS software and
projects, specifically within the Osmocom stack.  Used together with
[OsmoBTS](https://osmocom.org/projects/osmobts/wiki) you can get a pretty
standard GSM/GPRS/EGPRS BTS with Abis interface as per the relevant 3GPP specifications.
